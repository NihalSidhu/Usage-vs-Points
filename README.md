# Usage vs Points
When playing fantasy football, we often look for players who score the most points. We often look at past points scored to help us understand how much a player might score in the future. 

We might believe that past points scored is the only way to help us predict future player production. Luckily, there is another feature we can use that is known as player usage.


Player usage refers to the amount of times a player is involved throughout a game. A player's usage can include the number of times he ran the ball or was thrown the ball. In this study, we will dive into understand how player usage can be leveraged to understand and predict fantasy points scored.
